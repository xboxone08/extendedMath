EXTENDED MATH
=============
This module provides some functions to
quickly provide mathematical functions to do
things that would require time to do normally. Find the mean or gcf with a
simple function call that does all that for you.
Although these are probably in numpy, the numpy library is huge, and filled with
stuff that you probably don't need for quick mathematical calculations. This single filed,
native, Python module is small, and copy-pastable. To suggest more functions, please submit a request in issues
or make a pull request!
